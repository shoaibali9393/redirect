                        <p>The client SHOULD continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed. See section 8.2.3 for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this status code.</p>

                        <p>This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).</p>

                        <p>The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it.  This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.</p>

                        <p>Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the Depth header.  In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response.  To prevent this the server may return a 102 (Processing) status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.</p>

                        <p>As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.</p>

Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.</p>

                        <p>Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.</p>

                        <p>Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.</p>

                        <p>The 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by "captive portals" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not the intervening network infrastructure.  It is not intended to encouraged deployment of captive portals, only to limit the damage caused by them.</p>

                        <p>A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance of terms or other user interaction before granting access usually does so by identifing clients who have not done so ("unknown clients") using their MAC addresses.</p>

                        <p>Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP port 80, which is sent to a HTTP server (the "login server") dedicated to "logging in" unknown clients, and of course traffic to the login server itself.</p>

                        <p>In common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come from the origin server indicated in the request's URL.  This presents many security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be inserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be observing cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the user agent, and so on.</p>

                        <p>However, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other words, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces the same issues.</p>

                        <p>Also, note that captive portals using this status code on an SSL or TLS connection (commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.</p>
